## Pinball Research
For my pinball game I decided to create working paddles that shoot the ball up. For this i needed to look into different ways to make these paddles work. For this i looked into hinge joints and ApplyForceTowards(float targetRotation) to attempt an easier way for the same system.

### What sources or references have you identified as relevant to this task?
i used this a source on unity documentation to look into hinge joints further. I found that its component that groups 2 rigidbodies together, constraining them to move like they are connected by a hinge.(Technologies, s.d.) 
Ive looked deep into hinge joints and even tried to put one on my paddles, however it was a lot harder then I first thought and ended up not working how i wanted it to.

## Reflection

### What Went Well


### What Did Not Go Well


### What would you do differently next time?
Next time I will drastically simplify what i want to create while keeping the code unique. I will focus less on graphics and how the game looks while narrowing the concept. This will give me more time to focus on the code.
